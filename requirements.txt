LIWC features, postivie emotion (posemo) and negative emotion (negemo), are generated by 2015 Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analyzer. Complete features of text analysis on Yelp reviews can be found in LIWC2015_Yelp.csv

Basically LIWC is a mapping tool that gives each word in a corpus a category. Then it counts all the words in certain categories and returns the percentage for each category. 

In order to get LIWC features for this project, we downloaded the LIWC on our desktop first. Then we used the latest dictionay LIWC2015 and chose all the default categories. After importing the review.csv, which is a .csv file with only the text column form the origianl yelp.csv file, the analyzer generates an analysis results file in the form of .csv. To use the result file, we imported it in Python and extract related features. 

Screenshots of the process can be found at LIWC_procedure file.
