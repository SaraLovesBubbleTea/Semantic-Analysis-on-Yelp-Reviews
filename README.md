# ANLY512_FinalProject
This is a group project about Yelp review semantic analysis. Group members are Xiner Ning and Jin Yong Young. 

The original dataset contains 10,000 restaurant reviews on Yelp. Three different kinds of predictive models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM Regression) are used in predicting the star scores. Structure features and semantic features are extracted from the review texts. This project also uses review_style, whcih is included in the original data, to train the models.

Data is from [Yelp] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/wc6rzl1a2os721d/yelp.csv?dl=0).
